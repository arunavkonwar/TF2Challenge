# Creative Artificial Intelligence using Tensorflow 2.0 and Lucid

A creative exercise to generate art by visualising inner layers of different neural network architectures. These particular images were generated using the Inception V1 architecture, and visualizations were manipulated using Lucid library and Tensorflow 2.0

Visualizing targeted layers of a neural network enables us to dive deep into its inner workings. Here are some of the results generated using the code.
